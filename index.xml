      <description>As a graduate student, I had the opportunity to design my own Critical Thinking class. You&amp;rsquo;ll find the syllabus here.
As a teaching assistant, I was known among students for offering handouts and worksheets for each of my discussion sections (most of the time, anyway). This encouraged students to take class notes, naturally directed their attention to the most important points of the reading, and helped them to study for exams or write their papers.</description>
