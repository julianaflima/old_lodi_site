      <description>CT 1072 - Critical Thinking Seminar in Philosophy of Mind  In this course you will learn how to write a clear and coherent research paper, analyze arguments, some common fallacies, and to use thought experiments in arguments by reading ad critically discussing philosophy papers. You will also develop presentation skills through assignments that you will ask to give a presentation. The topic of the course is on the content of our thoughts (beliefs, desires, hopes) and whether there is a special class of thoughts that have the power to motivate action.</description>

      <description>As a graduate student, I had the opportunity to design my own Critical Thinking class. You&amp;rsquo;ll find the syllabus here.
I actively seek feedback from my students with mid-semester evaluations. Here you&amp;rsquo;ll find three different mid-semester evaluations I typically give to students: a general course evaluation, a course evaluation students take right after they submit their midterm assignment without knowing their grades, and another after they get back their graded midterm.</description>
